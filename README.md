# p2p-poc

## Introduction
This is a POC, about implementing the `libp2p`'s `go-libp2p` package for implementing a basic peer-to-peer publisher/subscriber (pubsub) system with using the `go-libp2p-pubsub` package. Using the `gossipsub` peer-to-peer pubsub implementations.

### libp2p
[libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/) is a network framework that allows you to write decentralized peer-to-peer applications. It evolved out of `IPFS` and became an independent project. There are certainly a ton of applications being built using `libp2p`. `IPFS`, `Parity`, `Ethereum`, `Filecoin`, `Polkadot` are some popular examples. `libp2p` provides flexible solutions for essential peer-to-peer elements like *transport*, *security*, *peer-routing*, and *content-discovery*. It consists of a catalogue of modules from which p2p network developers can select and reuse just the protocols they need, while making it easy to upgrade and interoperate between applications. libp2p has implementations in [`Go`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p), [`JavaScript`](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p), [`Rust`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p), [`Python`](https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p), and [`C++`](https://github.com/libp2p/cpp-libp2p). The specification of libp2p can be found in its [specs repo](https://github.com/libp2p/specs).

### gossipsub
The libp2p-pubsub has created a number of peer-to-peer pubsub implementations(e.g gossipsub, floodsub, fpisub) that have enabled real time peer-to-peer pubsub application development(read more about these different pubsub implementation from [here](https://hackernoon.com/exploring-libp2p-pubsub-protocol-implementations-891i32jq)). `gossipsub` is named after the fact that peers gossip to each other about which messages they have seen and use this information to maintain a message delivery network.
